                    <p class="text-muted">I have quite a broad and hands-on technical foundation, spanning AI research projects,
                        applied machine learning and MLOps, computer vision, as well as traditional software
                        development. I have built and deployed apps and models, designed data pipelines, worked with large-scale
                        datasets, and implemented end-to-end systems in production contexts. This mix of theory and
                        practice gives me the ability to understand the underlying details of tech, while still keeping a
                        systems-level view of how products are designed, built, and maintained over time.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">By becoming first PM and employee #0 in a startup developing a B2B AI SaaS, I had the chance to take the product
                        from 0 to 1. I owned the full lifecycle: vision and positioning, discovery and user research,
                        roadmap and prioritization, delivery rituals, and go-to-market. I set up the processes, tools,
                        and standards that helped a distributed team execute, and created the feedback loops needed to
                        steer strategy with real usage data. This experience taught me how to translate technical
                        capabilities into a clear product narrative, align stakeholders, and build a reliable product
                        foundation that can scale.</p>

Legacy skills paragraphs (kept for reference)

Artificial Intelligence
I was introduced to AI with the UTBM class "AI : fundamental concepts", I continued studying this field at UQAC with a general class on AI. I also perfected my skills in that department with 2 courses dedicated to neural networks : Deep Learning and Artificial Vision and Image Processing. These classes and the many projects I have done made me become passionate about this field and want to pursue it.

Big Data
Big Data is a field of study I started studying at UTBM with the class "Business Intelligence for Big Data". This course covered the visualization aspect, and the practical aspect was covered by the UQAC course "ML for Big Data", making use of Apache Spark and clusters to distribute data and tasks.

Machine Learning
With an introductory class on ML at UTBM, I was able to get a global overview of different Machine Learning techniques, as well as do a complete project based on ML. I also followed a course on "Parallel Computing and Multicore Architecture", which introduced me to parallel computing techniques.

Data Science
With Data Science being a concept found in many classes, I studied it through most of them, especially in the UTBM course "Data Science". It is also a skill I developed a lot through the 3 NVIDIA courses I followed online, which you can find in my certifications.

Optimization
I was introduced to applied computing and operational research with the UTBM course dedicated to that. I then followed two classes at UQAC, one dedicated to applied computing and optimization, and the other one on metaheuristics and optimization.

Data Structures
I followed the UQAC course "Advanced Data Structures and their algorithms", which gave me an overview of existing structures and how to use them. With the UTBM class "Classical and Quantum Algorithms", I was also sensitized to this branch of Computer Science. I also used databases in many of my projects, and also followed a course on their optimization.
