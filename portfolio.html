                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Minimax algorithm with performance improvements using the
                                UCI protocol</p>
                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/chess.jpg" alt="..."/>

                            <p class="portText">The engine was developed as part of a course on AI at Université du
                                Québec à Chicoutimi. The aim
                                was to make an Java engine capable of playing every move in under 1 second, and being
                                able to communicate with the Universal
                                Chess Interface protocol to play in a graphical interface. In order to focus on the
                                algorithm, we used the <i>chesslib</i>
                                library, providiing us list of legal moves for a position, bitboards, and other useful
                                tools.</p>

                            <p class="portText">To search the game tree, we implemented Minimax, an algorithm used in
                                game theory that aims to
                                minimize the loss or degradation of a game situation. It involves "virtually" evolving a
                                starting situation and imagining
                                all possible responses from the opposing player at a given depth (5 for our chess
                                engine). The best outcome is then
                                chosen and taken back to the
                                root, which determines the next move to be made. In the game of chess, the tree of
                                possibilities grows quickly because of
                                the many possibilities available each turn. Therefore, much of the work in this area
                                involves trying to reduce the search
                                field and optimize the code in order to reduce execution time.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Paired with Minimax, we also used a Quiescence Search to
                                finish exploring unstable leaf nodes, to help solve the horizon effect. This problem
                                arises in the complex decision trees
                                of games like chess or go, where the tree is too wide and deep to explore completely, so
                                we must limit our exploration.
                                However, this has the disadvantage of making us blind to responses that we could have
                                studied in the next iteration.
                                One way to solve this problem is to detect if a leaf of the tree is "unstable," and
                                perform additional search to
                                determine the true value of that leaf. In our case, an unstable leaf is one where the
                                previous move was a capture.
                                For these leaves, we perform a quiescence search and further explore the branch,
                                considering only captures in order to
                                limit the branching factor. Essentially, if we finish the MiniMax tree exploration with
                                a capture by a queen, this
                                additional search ensures that the queen will not be captured immediately by a piece
                                covering the one we captured.</p>

                            <p class="portText">In order to be able to explore that much under a second, we implemented
                                numerous optimizations. The
                                first obvious one is Alpha-Bêta pruning, ensuring that the branches of the tree that do
                                not improve the player's gain
                                value are pruned.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Alpha-Bêta pruning relying on comparisons, it is possible to increase
                                the number of pruned branches
                                (and therefore improve performance) by evaluating promising positions as early as
                                possible : this is called Move Ordering.
                                First, the Most Valuable Victim/Least Valuable Attacker (MVV/LVA) table is used to
                                analyze capturing moves, which assigns
                                a value based on the piece that is capturing and the piece that is being captured.
                                Therefore, if the victim is a Queen,
                                the value returned will be higher than if the victim is a Pawn. Then, after considering
                                the victim, we also sort based
                                on the attacker. It is better to capture a piece with a Pawn than with a Rook, because
                                often the capturing piece is
                                endangered. The MVV/LVA table handles capturing moves ordering, while non-capturing
                                moves are ordered using two heuristics,
                                the Killer Move and the History Moves. The first one is based on the concept of the
                                Killer Move, which is a move that
                                causes pruning. Specifically, if a move threatens a Queen, it will cause significant
                                pruning in the tree because all moves
                                that do not move or protect the threatened queen will be eliminated. The second one is
                                the most effective method for
                                sorting our non-capturing moves because it takes into account the success of moves in
                                the past. Each time a non-capturing
                                move is successful in causing pruning, its value is increased. This simple concept
                                places moves that have previously caused
                                cutoffs (and so are likely to do that again) forward.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Another way to reduce the game tree search without pruning is to use
                                Transposition Tables.
                                This is an optimization that is not reset between calls to MiniMax. Essentially, if a
                                position is explored, we store
                                a representation of this position - called a Zobrist Hash, which allows us to
                                efficiently store a position and its
                                information - and the value associated with it. This way, for each position explored
                                during MiniMax, we check beforehand
                                if we do not already know the position and therefore its value, thus avoiding costly
                                exploration.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Finally, we also used three other pruning methods. Futility pruning is
                                applied when there is a depth
                                of 3 or less remaining in the search and helps to prune positions that have no
                                potential. For each depth, a value is
                                associated, and if the evaluation of the position added to this value is less than alpha
                                - or if the evaluation of the
                                position subtracted from this value is greater than beta - we consider that this
                                position cannot improve the best move :
                                it can therefore be pruned. Null Move pruning is based on a rather amusing and
                                humiliating concept : if we play a "blank"
                                move - that is, we do not play and therefore virtually leave two moves to the opponent -
                                and the latter still suffers a
                                significant enough deficit to cause alpha-beta pruning, then we can prune all of this
                                part of the tree. Delta pruning
                                is applied only to the Quiescence Search and works roughly the same way as futility
                                pruning. Delta is given a fixed
                                value, and if the evaluation of a position to which delta is added does not improve the
                                best value, we consider that
                                this branch is not worth exploring. This helps to avoid exploring unnecessary branches
                                of the tree, which often happens
                                in the Quiescence Search, which aims to explore all captures.</p>

                            <p class="portText">The other part of exploring the game tree that takes time is to evaluate
                                each position. To do so
                                efficiently, we decided to implement a "lazy" evaluation for positions that only needed
                                an approximation of the exact score,
                                and to do an in-depth evaluation when an exact score was required. The lazy evaluation
                                only consists of an evaluation of
                                the material both sides have.</p>

                                the chessboard. For each square,
                                a value - bonus or penalty - is therefore defined that will be added to the value of the
                                piece. In order to be as
                                exhaustive as possible, we used two PSTs per piece, one for the midgame and one for the
                                endgame. We can therefore see
                                in the figure opposite, representing the PST of the knight for the midgame, that
                                positions centered on the chessboard,
                                which therefore control more squares, are valued, and that positions that are very
                                off-center are penalized.</p>

                            <p class="portText">To separate positions with the same pieces, we also implemented two
                                other evaluations to complete the
                                material one. The first one concerns the position of the pawns : we slightly penalize
                                doubled pawns, blocked pawns and
                                isolated pawns. In this way, we do not modify the evaluation enough to influence the
                                material, but with equal material we
                                favor more advantageous positions. The other one consists of checking which color
                                "controls" each square on the
                                chessboard : if Whites have more pieces that can go to this square, we will consider
                                that Whites control this square. It
                                is somewhat a modified Static Exchange Evaluator, which concerns all squares.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Finally, since boards cannot be evaluated the same depending on which
                                game phase we are in, our
                                evaluation function was inspired by the principle of Tapered Evaluation, which consists
                                of modifying the evaluation
                                according to the progress of the game. We therefore applied weights to the three types
                                of evaluations that we implement
                                depending on the phase of the game we are in.</p>

                            <p class="portText">This assignment allowed us to discover the principle of Minimax and its
                                multiple optimizations,
                                which are popular for adversarial exploration. Even if we had already implemented it
                                during our university course,
                                it was very formative to start from this already known base and push it so that it
                                reaches its full potential.
                                We therefore explored several optimization techniques, whether in algorithms or even in
                                pure programming (moderate
                                use of loops, numerous rereads of the code to avoid duplicating actions, etc). This
                                work, complex but rewarding,
                                pushed us to go beyond the work required to create an engine that we are very proud to
                                have designed and that
                                represents a great success for us.</p>

                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/gan.jpg" alt="..."/>

                            <p class="portText">I chose to do this project in the computer vision course while at UQAC mainly because I had
                                never worked with generative models, but also because they require lots of data and computing power. This
                                forced me to use <i>cloud computing</i> services and get out of my comfort zone - and step into a more
                                "realistic" deep learning environment. A more general objective of the project was also to
                                develop and stick to a methodology, and mine was to take things step by step and gradually increase the
                                difficulty of the tasks I was attempting.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Although my final goal was to make a conditional Generative Adversarial Network, I started by
                                "just" developing a GAN from an artwork dataset. I used common architectures of Deep Convolutional GAN
                                for my generator and discriminator, which are summarized below.</p>

                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="margin-bottom:10px" src="assets/img/portfolio/generator.png" alt="..."/>
                            <p class="portImgTitle" style="margin-bottom:50px"><i>Architecture of the generator</i></p>

                            <p class="portImgTitle"><i>Architecture of the discriminator</i></p>

                            <p class="portText">This worked fairly well, but the dataset contained very unbalanced
                            classes, which hindered greatly its ability to generate artworks from different styles. For that reason, I switched
                            to another bigger dataset, that I found on
                            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sivarazadi/wikiart-art-movementsstyles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaggle</a>.
                            Although it suffered from unbalanced data as well, the least populated classes contained well over 1000 paintings,
                            which I deemed enough to get decent results. Using the same architecture as described earlier, the training of the
                            GAN generated this GIF :</p>

                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="margin-bottom:30px; width:50%" src="assets/img/portfolio/gan_training.gif" alt="..."/>

                            <p class="portText">I then divided my journey to building a CGAN in three major steps : first, building a CGAN
                                generating artworks from only two classes with one channel (i.e. a grayscale image), then adding color, and
                                finally all the classes. Training a CGAN being way longer than training a GAN, this step-by-step process
                                allowed me to test different configurations while minimizing the wait time between versions.</p>

                            <p class="portText">This strategy allowed me to single out problems with my CGAN implementation, especially one
                                induced by <i>batch normalization</i>. Given that this process normalizes the activations of a layer on a mini-batch
                                of inputs, the standardization operation interferes with the storage of conditional information in
                                normalizing the discriminator entries on the batch. This caused my resulting generated images to be limited to noise,
                                and did not allow for the discriminator to train. Handling this problem - and others - allowed me to get better
                                results, and more convincing training processes.</p>

                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="margin-bottom:10px; width:70%" src="assets/img/portfolio/gan_curve.png" alt="..."/>
                            <p class="portImgTitle"><i>Training curves of the CGAN</i></p>

                            <p class="portText">However, I still was not satisfied with the conditional information. Although the problems were
                                probably also caused by insufficient training and too few data, I emphasized the information by scaling it
                                up as a "fourth" channel using a fully connected layer in the final code to ensure my implementation was not
                                the problem. The results I obtained were some of the best I got with conditional GANs, but were nowhere near what
                                I obtained with the basic Generative Adversarial Networks, an example of which you can see at the top of this page.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Although this project did not deliver results-wise, it allowed me to get a grip of GANs, and
                                continued to make myself more comfortable with Deep Learning. Furthermore, the size of the data and model
                                parameters made me use GPUs and TPUs for the training through services like Google Colab and Kaggle Notebooks,
                                which was fairly new to me. The fact that training an iteration of the model took over 8 hours also forced me to
                                really apply my methodology and think ahead before running code, which is something I often overlook, preferring
                                to <i>try and retry</i>.</p>

                                Data.
                                We explored some of the optimization methods applied to the Random Forest algorithm that

                                problem.</p>

                            <p class="portText">The dataset we used came from Kaggle and can be found with this
                                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashis74017/stock-market-data-nifty-50-stocks-1-min-data"

                                It consists of data concerning the NIFTY 100, a well-diversified 100 companies index
                                reflecting overall market conditions
                                in India. We chose this dataset not only for its concrete and serious data but also its
                                size : it is just under 70 GB
                                with 66 features. The data was not ready for use, so we had to make a couple of
                                operations on it. First, cleaning it up,
                                then creating the label our Random Forest was going to predict. We also created weights
                                to balance the model, as well as
                                do some dimensionnality reduction with Principal Component Analysis to make the data
                                easier to use.</p>

                            <p class="portText">To do our tests, we first used a local Spark environment using a machine
                                with 20 cores, 16GB of
                                RAM and 3.6GHz. However, we quickly realized it was not enough to handle data this size,
                                so we used a cloud solution :
                                Digital Ocean Droplets with 16GB of RAM and 8 AMD vCPUs. With this configuration, we
                                were able to test different models
                                on our data, and see the difference between them.</p>

                            <p class="portImgTitle"><i>Comparison of the execution time and F-measure of the different
                                studied models</i></p>

                            <p class="portText">With this, we were able to come to two conclusions. First, with the
                                similar execution times of
                                the Random Forest and the Decision Tree, we were able to demonstrate the power of
                                parallelization, as the Forest is
                                made of many single trees - but they still run in about the same time. Secondly, we
                                tested the pyspark GBTClassifier
                                model, a model that uses Gradient Boosted Trees. This model, which appeared more
                                recently than the others, works
                                according to a simple principle : we train a standard decision tree, then train multiple
                                models to predict and correct
                                the error of the first model. Since this model also uses an ensemble of trees and is
                                supposed to be more performant
                                than the RandomForestClassifier, we thought it was advisable to try it. However, despite
                                an execution time of 16h 27m
                                40s, we were forced to stop it before it finished training. This is due to the fact that
                                boosting is a
                                technique that sequentially combines models and does not favor parallelization.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Concerning data parallelization, we also tried running a scikit-learn
                                model on the data. However,
                                the transformation of the training dataframe into a Pandas dataframe could not be
                                executed. Indeed, when performing this
                                task, we try to retrieve the data distributed on the cluster in order to centralize it
                                on a core, which is not robust
                                enough to support such a large amount of data.</p>

                                size</i></p>

                            <p class="portText">This assignment was meant to compare different learning techniques, and
                                several conclusions were
                                drawn. First, as seen in the article, parallelization should be applied to both tasks
                                and data. Our comparison between PySpark and scikit-learn showed the importance of
                                distributing data when
                                working with larger scales, as the non-distributed method was simply unable to handle
                                such large data sets. Second,
                                we saw the impact of parallelization of calculations in our comparison with Gradient
                                Boosted Trees. While the Random
                                Forest, which uses the bagging principle, is easily parallelizable to the point that its
                                execution time is almost
                                equal to that of a Decision Tree, the sequential boosting technique is not well suited
                                (at least in its basic form)
                                for distribution and therefore for such large data sets. The sequential boosting has a
                                nearly linear curve and
                                therefore does not scale well to larger sizes, while the parallelized Random Forest has
                                a curve that increases very
                                little and only changes slightly, demonstrating its resistance to scaling. With these
                                two points in mind, we were able to
                                conclude that PySpark's distributed system is crucial and that the simplicity and
                                effectiveness of the Random Forest
                                allows it to maintain a reasonable timeline.</p>

                            <p class="portText">This project was made in the Data Science Project course at the
                                Université de Technologie
                                de Belfort-Montbéliard. We acted as a mini Scrum Team in a company, managing all aspects
                                of the project including
                                human resources, budget, planning, business model, specifications, communication, and
                                the development process.
                                Our efforts spanned over a period of 6 months, resulting in the creation of a complete
                                software application.
                                As a result of our hard work and dedication, we were given the opportunity to present
                                our project to a startup incubator.
                            </p>

                            <p class="portText">This idea came about after finding a report from UK Power Networks - an
                                electricity distribution system
                                operator covering part of England - following a feed-in tariff scheme introduced by the
                                UK to encourage electricity
                                generation using small-scale systems (≤5MW). The associated dataset included over 25
                                thousand days of collected data in
                                domestic sites containing solar panels, adding up to over 171 million measurements.
                                The data wasn't perfect as it contained some missing values making some measurements
                                unusable, but we still had enough
                                data after cleaning it to stick with this idea.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Before moving forward, we tested the plausibility of our project to
                                predict the electrical production
                                of solar panels from weather data by implementing a simple Linear Regression model and
                                plotting its predictions.</p>

                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="margin-bottom:10px;width:70%"

                            <p class="portImgTitle"><i>Comparison between average values predicted by a Linear
                                Regression model and real ones in the test set</i></p>

                            <p class="portText">Although these results were far from perfect, they were good for a basic
                                unoptimized model, so
                                it encouraged us to keep going, having seen the potential of the project. We then tested
                                12 different models on the
                                dataset to see which class of models would perform better, and found out that models
                                based on a Random Forest outperformed
                                the others.</p>

                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="margin-bottom:10px;width:60%"

                            </p>

                            <p class="portText">We then optimized all of the promising models by searching for their
                                optimal hyperparameters using
                                grid searches. Finally, we decided to use the CatBoost model as it is the one that
                                performed with the most consistency,
                                as our tests using the Root Mean Squared Error showed.</p>

                            <p class="portText">To showcase this model, we build a product around it, focused on France.
                                We used React and Django
                                to develop a website aiming to sell our model as a subscription, following the trendy
                                shift of business models from
                                product to services. Using weather APIs such as OpenWeather and Solcast and a Leaflet
                                map, we only require that the
                                user selects his location on the map to predict the estimated production, financial gain
                                and other features.</p>

                            <p class="portText">This project was a very eye-opening experience as it allowed us to
                                envision the development of a
                                product, a business model, and more generally, the opportunity to integrate artificial
                                intelligence into a realistic

                                meeting with a startup incubator and
                                thinking about taking this project to the next step was an amazing way to get a glimpse
                                of what being an entrepreneur

                            <p class="portText">This project is based on the work presented by Vasile Purdil et
                                Stefan-Gheorghe Pentiuc in their
                                paper named “MRTree-A Scalable MapReduce Algorithm for Building Decision Trees”,
                                published in 2014.
                                The aim of the project was to demonstrate the scalability of the distributed version of
                                the Decision Tree model,
                                which I did in a local Spark environment using a machine with 20 cores, 16GB of RAM and
                                3.6GHz.</p>

                            <p class="portText">The data I used is the same as in the article, it is a dataset
                                containing unclean data describing
                                characteristics of persons in order to predict their class of income. It is available
                                following this
                                <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>.
                                Once the data cleaned,
                                the dataset contained 14 features and 45222 records, and had a size of about 6 Mo. I
                                then converted all the values into
                                numerical ones to create a Resilient Distributed Dataset of LabeledPoints to feed to the
                                Decision Tree.</p>

                            <p class="portText">To demonstrate the importance of distribution, I needed a bigger dataset
                                so I scaled it up by duplicating
                                it up to 50 times. This way, I was able to get the graph below, confirming what the
                                scientific paper described.</p>

                            <p class="portText">I also carried out different tests during this project, like for example
                                focusing on the variation
                                of the execution time when changing the number of cores in the local cluster from 4 to
                                20. As exepected, we can see
                                that the time decreases with the addition of cores.</p>

                            <p class="portText">This project was a great way to get familiar with PySpark and different
                                distributed notions,
                                also comparing them to their scikit-learn equivalents in the process. Re-demonstrating
                                the improvements put forward
                                by the article really shows the importance of distribution in Big Data scenarios and was
                                a first step towards
                                working in more "realistic" environments, as opposed to working locally on a laptop.</p>

                            <p class="portText"> This project was an exciting opportunity to discover the fundamental
                                concepts of artificial
                                intelligence and work on algorithms covered in class. We made the choice to work on Love
                                Letter, a popular
                                zero sum card game, meaning that the gain of one player is balanced by the loss of the
                                other player, making
                                it an ideal candidate for AI development.</p>

                            <p class="portText"> The artificial intelligence we set out to develop needed to be able to
                                act like a player :</p>
                            <ul style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5rem">
                                <li>Know which cards are on the table (the isolated cards at the beginning of the game
                                    and all the played cards until the moment it needs to make a decision).
                                </li>
                                <li>Draw and play cards, taking into account all the special cases related to the
                                    abilities of the cards and favoring the situation that will be most advantageous for
                                    it in the future, based on all possible situations.
                                </li>
                                <li>Generate the game tree by considering all possibilities. In other words, to decide
                                    which card will be the most interesting to keep in hand, it must generate all the
                                    possibilities of cards that the opponent might play and see in which situations it
                                    will have the best results. To do this, it can deduce, based on the cards that have
                                    already been played, the ones that are already on the table, and the ones it has in
                                    its hand, which card the opponent can play and therefore know which situation might
                                    cause it to lose.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="portText">To create our AI, we implemented two key algorithms: DFS (depth-first
                                search) and
                                Negamax. These algorithms allowed our AI to explore the possible moves in the game and
                                make decisions based on the likely outcomes. In particular, the Negamax algorithm, a
                                simplified version of the
                                MinMax algorithm that is based on the principle of a zero-sum game, allowed us to
                                efficiently evaluate the potential
                                value of each move, helping our AI make intelligent decisions even in the face of
                                uncertainty. The logic behind
                                the algorithm is simple : player A, who is searching the game tree, will always try to
                                maximize their moves and
                                minimize those of their opponent. Although there are not many rounds in a game of Love
                                Letter (a maximum of 8 rounds),
                                the Negamax algorithm requires too many calculations to predict all the possible
                                outcomes of the game in cases where
                                the players have exhausted the deck and the victory is decided by the highest card. In
                                order to reduce the number
                                of states generated by the artificial intelligence - and reduce the time of reflection -
                                we decided to implement
                                alpha-beta pruning, which keeps only the promising branches of the tree based on
                                previously visited nodes.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Although we didn't have time to make an interface for playing the game -
                                it is only playable in console -
                                we did make a prototype of what we would've done with more time.
                                It is accessible with the following <a

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Development of a smart vacuum agent living in a mansion,
                                picking up dust and jewels with intelligent pathing</p>
                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/vacuum.jpg" alt="..."/>

                            <p class="portText">This project was made as part of a course on AI and was done to create
                                an smart agent with
                                an internal state based on the Belief-Desire-Intention model, progressing in a updating
                                environment. Both the
                                agent and the environment are executed in parallel in two different threads.</p>

                            <p class="portText">The vacuum moves in an environment represented by a two-dimensional map
                                containing cells,
                                each of which can contain dust, jewels, or a vacuum. The initial state of the map is
                                determined by randomly
                                generating objects based on certain rates, and the map is then updated over time using
                                different rates. The
                                environment is partially observable, meaning that the agent's sensors do not give it
                                access to the state of the
                                environment at all times. It is also stochastic, meaning that the outcome of an action
                                is not certain, and episodic,
                                meaning that it is divided into a sequence of independent episodes. The agent's actions
                                are limited to moving in one
                                of four directions or performing no action, and its performance is measured by the
                                number of steps taken and the
                                number of objects cleaned up.</p>

                            <p class="portText">The agent is made up of sensors and effectors, as well as an internal
                                state. The sensors,
                                represented by the Sensor class, are the interface between the agent and the map. They
                                provide the agent with
                                information about the environment, such as the presence of jewels or dust and the
                                location of the agent on the map.
                                The effectors, represented by the Effector class, are the actions that the agent can
                                take on the environment. They
                                include functions like traveling to a specific location and performing a specific action
                                on a cell. The internal
                                state of the agent includes a list of intentions, metrics about its progress, and a copy
                                of the map. It also has a
                                boolean value indicating which exploration algorithm to use. The agent's mental state is
                                based on the
                                Belief-Desire-Intention model, which means it acts rationally and executes actions that
                                maximize its performance
                                based on its perception of the world and its knowledge. The agent's beliefs are based on
                                the information it
                                perceives from the environment and its own knowledge, and its desires are its motivation
                                to act, with the ultimate
                                goal of cleaning the map of all dust. The agent's intentions are the actions it plans to
                                take to achieve its goals.
                                His performance is defined by a formula taking into account the overall cleanness of the
                                map, the battery used by the
                                agent and giving penalties for the jewels it vaccumed.</p>

                            <p class="portText">We conducted a series of tests on the agent in order to determine its
                                optimal learning frequency. The
                                lower this frequency, it will have an optimized path for the dusts existing at the time
                                of the creation of the path,
                                but will miss out on the dusts that have spawned since then, with the environments
                                running continuously in parallel.
                                We conducted tests with exploration frequencies ranging from 1 to 5 actions, as well as
                                an infinite frequency,
                                in order to measure the importance of this parameter. We recorded the performance of the
                                system at various intervals
                                over different periods in order to obtain a representative measurement. We found that an
                                exploration frequency of 1
                                resulted in a lot of hesitation on the part of the agent, while higher frequencies
                                allowed it to be more efficient
                                in cleaning the map.</p>

                            <p class="portText">The agent uses either the BFS or A* algorithms to search for the next
                                action to take.
                                Both algorithms are implemented in the Graph class and involve creating nodes for the
                                trees and the agent's
                                intentions, as well as building the solution from the goal node. The BFS algorithm
                                expands each node by visiting all
                                of its neighbors before visiting the neighbors of those neighbors, while the A*
                                algorithm uses a heuristic function
                                to prioritize nodes that are closer to the goal. Both algorithms also have a test for
                                the goal and a method for
                                building the solution from the goal node. The BFS algorithm has a high space complexity
                                due to the large number of
                                nodes that it generates, but it has a low time complexity due to its simple expansion
                                process. The A* algorithm has
                                a lower space complexity and a higher time complexity due to the more involved expansion
                                process and use of the
                                heuristic function.</p>

                            <p class="portText">This project made us create an agent made up of sensors, effectors, and
                                an internal state,
                                including a list of intentions and metrics about the agent's progress. The agent's
                                mental state is based on the
                                Belief-Desire-Intention model, which means it acts rationally and executes actions that
                                maximize its performance
                                based on its perception of the world and its knowledge. The agent uses either the BFS or
                                A* algorithm to search
                                for the next action to take.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">These tools were the result of my work during my 6-month
                                internship as an engineer assistant internship at Luxembourg Online</p>
                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/erp.jpg" alt="..."/>

                            <p class="portText">During my fourth year internship at the Université de Technologie de
                                Belfort-Montbéliard,
                                I had the opportunity to work at Luxembourg Online, a company located in the Grand Duchy
                                of Luxembourg.
                                I joined the software development team at this independent company, which has been a
                                prominent presence in Luxembourg for
                                over 25 years. While working on a module for managing recruitment, I solidified my web
                                development skills
                                (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) and also learned Luxembourg Online's proprietary language,
                                OSL. I also participated
                                in larger projects, gaining experience and confidence throughout my internship.</p>

                            <p class="portText">My primary task during this internship was developping a tool that would
                                be added to the ERP to help
                                with the recruitment process in the company, that lacked structure until then. The
                                absence of a dedicated tool not
                                only hindered the efficiency of the process, but also constituted a very time-consuming
                                task for HR. The main objective
                                of the recruitment module was the administrative management of applications, and thus to
                                have not only a global
                                vision of the applications in progress at a given time, but also a history of
                                applications. It is essential to
                                keep a record of applications as it can, for example, allow a candidate to be contacted
                                again if the position
                                they applied for is recruiting again.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Another major challenge was to develop a tool that met the needs of
                                Luxembourg Online's HR while remaining sufficiently general to suit other companies
                                using Luxembourg Online's ERP.
                                Although the initial objectives were relatively modest, limited to the simple management
                                of positions and
                                applications, they became more ambitious as I became more familiar with the environment.
                                In fact,
                                the management of advertisements was later added, then the rating of candidates by
                                targeted users,
                                the management of interviews, and finally the addition of an automated email and
                                notification system.
                                As the supplement to be developed had no predecessor, the problem in determining the
                                objectives was not
                                "how to improve the existing tool", but rather "how to frame the recruitment process
                                while making it easier for
                                HR to reduce their workload".</p>

                            <p class="portText">Throughout my internship, I tried to put a focus on modernity and user
                                interface. I was always allowed
                                to develop a first version of my module as I saw fit, before reviewing it with my tutor
                                or a long-time employee,
                                familiar with the shop and responsible for validating the interfaces of additions to it.
                                Of course, I was not
                                given free rein : my module still had to fit in with the rest of the ERP and respect its
                                graphic charter.
                                In fact, the shop is a tool that has been in place for many years and I would describe
                                its interface as "vintage",
                                which meant I had to create similar elements. Similarly, there are ways of doing things
                                that are deeply ingrained
                                in the ERP as they are present in many supplements to which I had to conform, although I
                                personally considered
                                them less effective. In addition, one of the reasons I enjoyed web development was the
                                freedom to do anything -
                                whether visually with CSS or functionally with JavaScript - but when I had to set up
                                something that already
                                existed in the shop, my creativity and contribution were restricted. However, my
                                constant
                                proposals of modernization and improvement ideas bore fruit. Indeed, quite quickly -
                                after a little less than two
                                months in the company - my tutor considered that my way of seeing and representing
                                things was innovative and
                                constructive. I therefore had parallel missions to my module to carry out, such as the
                                redesign of the company's
                                agenda, the creation of a drag and drop area for files, or the design of the user
                                interface of another module.</p>

                            <p class="portImgTitle"><i>Gantt diagram of my time at Luxembourg Online</i></p>

                            <p class="portText">I am generally satisfied with the work I have done at Luxembourg Online
                                and the skills I have acquired.
                                Over the 23 weeks of my internship, I was able to carry out a project from start to
                                finish independently, by
                                defining a specification, working in collaboration with the main users to design a
                                product that meets their needs,
                                while ensuring a tool that is sufficiently general to be sold and exploited by any
                                company.
                                Concretely, this is a module for the ERP that is fully integrated into the latter and
                                consists of 4 pages, allowing
                                the management of applications, as well as open positions, published advertisements, and
                                platforms receiving these
                                advertisements.
                                I also produced a tool that facilitates the download and handling of files within the
                                ERP, which will be added to the
                                company's style guide and will therefore be reused in other projects.
                                Finally, I also designed a prototype to improve a crucial tool used daily in many
                                services - the company's agenda,
                                greatly facilitating its use by adding relevant and problem-specific features.</p>

                            <p class="portText">The development of a website for UTBM to regroup their different tools
                                was
                                a complex and challenging project that required careful planning and attention to
                                detail.
                                The aim was to provide assistance and information on various computer services used
                                within
                                the educational institution, given a four-month timeframe and the freedom to use any
                                technologies desired,
                                with the requirement that the site be maintainable and developable by others in the
                                future.
                                The project focused on user interface design, but also required work on the back-end for
                                the
                                site to function properly.</p>

                            <p class="portText">After having understood the needs of the future users for this tool, we
                                defined the architecture
                                our website was going to have and made a prototype based on the architecture. This
                                interactive mock-up of the web
                                platform was designed to demonstrate the simplified functioning of the site to potential
                                users and was intended
                                to provide a realistic representation of the final product without requiring actual
                                development work.
                                It is accessible with the following <a

                            </p>

                            <p class="portText">Concerning the database design, the initial design for the database
                                included tables for categories,
                                articles, and their contents. As the development of the site progressed and we gained
                                more knowledge, we realized that the
                                database architecture could be simplified. First, by using a MarkDown text editor for
                                the descriptions of articles, which
                                allowed us to eliminate some tables made superfluous. The final design for the database
                                included tables for categories,
                                articles, users, media files, settings, and logs, and included an admin user on the
                                MySQL server.</p>

                            <p class="portText">We made several technical choices in the creation of the site.
                                We used Figma to create prototypes and design systems, as it is lightweight, fast and
                                allows for instant collaboration on files.
                                For the front-end of the site, we considered multiple JavaScript frameworks including
                                React JS, Angular JS, and Vue JS, as we wanted
                                a modern, responsive framework that would ensure the website would look great and
                                function smoothly on a wide range of devices.
                                Ultimately, we chose React JS due to its ability to create interactive user interfaces,
                                define simple views for each state of the
                                application, and update graphical interface data as it changes in the database. We also
                                used Gatsby JS, a static website generator,
                                to improve the performance of the website in terms of loading and general functioning.
                                For the back-end, we used Node.js, particularly the Express framework, and the GraphQL
                                query language for the
                                management of data. Finally, we chose MySQL for the database management system.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Throughout the project, we remained focused on achieving our goals and
                                ensuring that the
                                new design would be a success. We consistently tracked progress and made adjustments as
                                needed to ensure that the final product met our high standards. In the end, the designed
                                website that we
                                handed over to UTBM was well-received by users. Overall, it was a challenging but
                                rewarding project that demonstrated
                                our ability to successfully tackle complex design challenges, as well as making us learn
                                about the relationships
                                between the different technologies we used. Finally, it was one of our first insights on
                                how to organize large
                                projects, and the time and effort required for project management, task allocation, and
                                hierarchy in development.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Following a campaign of surveys within both students and
                                employees of UTBM, re-design of the UI of the online work tool of UTBM "Moodle" to make
                                it fit with the user needs</p>
                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/moodle.jpg" alt="..."/>
                            <p class="portText">Our project to redesign the UI of UTBM's Moodle resources website was a
                                comprehensive and
                                thorough process that involved several key steps. It originated from our personal daily
                                use of Moodle, we found the tool fonctional and well suited for the task, but not it's
                                User Interface. This is why we focused our approach on user needs, and tried to rethink
                                the UI around those needs in 4 steps.</p>

                            <p class="portText"> The first phase was to create a survey to gather user needs and
                                preferences - and assure
                                ourselves everyone felt the need for a new UI - which we distributed to a large number
                                of users. This allowed us to get a broad range of feedback that would inform the design
                                process. As expected, a lot of featured features were only used by 25% of users a couple
                                of times a month.</p>

                            <p class="portText">The second phase was to convene a panel of a dozen different users to
                                discuss the
                                results of the survey and provide further input and guidance. This panel was composed of
                                users with a variety of backgrounds and experience levels, and their insights were
                                invaluable in shaping the direction of the project.</p>

                            <p class="portText">In the third phase, we created a test version of the new Moodle design,
                                incorporating
                                the feedback from the survey and the panel. This allowed us to see how the design would
                                work in practice and make any necessary adjustments.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Finally, we held another meeting with the panel to discuss the test
                                version and get
                                their feedback. Based on their comments and suggestions, we made further refinements to
                                the design before presenting the final version to UTBM for consideration.</p>

                            <p class="portText">Overall, the project was a resounding success. UTBM was impressed by the
                                thoroughness
                                and professionalism of our process, and ultimately decided to implement our revamped
                                version of Moodle as the official one. We are proud of the work we did and are confident
                                that the new design will greatly improve the user experience for UTBM students and
                                faculty.</p>
