                For the past 5 years, my studies train me to become an engineer, and I have dedicated the last 3 to
                pursue Computer Science. Since then, I have developed a passion for Artificial Intelligence, being
                fascinated by the infinite of possibilities this field brings and wanting to be part of the
                progress. Starting in September, I'm actually getting a chance to do that with my end-of-studies
                internship

                knowledge, and I specialized in Computer Science - more specifically Data Science and Artificial
                Intelligence - in the latter two.

                Whether it is by cooking or by doing projects like this website, I love to take on new challenges
                and see myself improve at new skills. I especially enjoy trying to be creative with what I know and
                adding my touch to the things I do. I have a lot of fun learning a new skill and perfecting it by
                trial and error while creating something unique : even if it fails, at least I've learnt something !
